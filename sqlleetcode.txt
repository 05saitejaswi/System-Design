1. Basic SELECT Statements

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;


Explanation:

Retrieves data from one or more columns in a table.

You can select all columns using *.

Tricks/Patterns:

Always know what table you are querying.

Alias columns with AS for readability:

SELECT first_name AS Name, salary AS Salary
FROM employees;


Use DISTINCT to remove duplicates:

SELECT DISTINCT department FROM employees;

2. Filtering with WHERE, AND/OR, IN, BETWEEN, LIKE

Syntax:

SELECT *
FROM employees
WHERE salary > 50000
  AND department IN ('IT', 'HR')
  OR hire_date BETWEEN '2023-01-01' AND '2023-12-31';


Explanation:

WHERE filters rows.

Logical operators: AND, OR, NOT.

IN checks multiple values.

BETWEEN checks a range.

LIKE searches patterns (% = any chars, _ = single char).

Tricks:

Use parentheses to avoid logical mistakes:

WHERE (salary > 50000 AND department='IT') OR department='HR'


LIKE 'A%' → starts with A, '_%' → contains any single char.

3. ORDER BY, LIMIT

Syntax:

SELECT name, salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 5;


Explanation:

ORDER BY sorts data (ASC ascending, DESC descending).

LIMIT restricts rows returned.

Tricks:

For top N problems, combine ORDER BY + LIMIT.

To get the second highest salary:

SELECT DISTINCT salary
FROM employees
ORDER BY salary DESC
LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1;

4. Aggregations: COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, MAX

Syntax:

SELECT COUNT(*), SUM(salary), AVG(salary), MIN(salary), MAX(salary)
FROM employees;


Explanation:

Use aggregation functions to summarize data.

Tricks:

Use COUNT(column_name) to count only non-null values.

Combine with GROUP BY to get summaries per group.

5. GROUP BY and HAVING

Syntax:

SELECT department, AVG(salary)
FROM employees
GROUP BY department
HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;


Explanation:

GROUP BY → aggregate data by a column.

HAVING → filter aggregated results (like WHERE for groups).

Tricks:

Always filter before grouping using WHERE if needed.

Use HAVING only for aggregated values.

6. Joins: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS

Syntax Examples:

-- INNER JOIN: only matching rows
SELECT a.name, b.salary
FROM employees a
INNER JOIN salaries b ON a.id = b.emp_id;

-- LEFT JOIN: all from left, matching from right
SELECT a.name, b.salary
FROM employees a
LEFT JOIN salaries b ON a.id = b.emp_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN: all from right, matching from left
SELECT a.name, b.salary
FROM employees a
RIGHT JOIN salaries b ON a.id = b.emp_id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN: all from both
SELECT a.name, b.salary
FROM employees a
FULL OUTER JOIN salaries b ON a.id = b.emp_id;

-- CROSS JOIN: Cartesian product
SELECT a.name, b.salary
FROM employees a
CROSS JOIN salaries b;


Tricks:

Use INNER JOIN when you only want matches.

LEFT JOIN → find missing data in the right table (NULL check).

For SQL 50 patterns: missing purchases, missing orders → LEFT JOIN + IS NULL.

7. Subqueries

Syntax:

SELECT name
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);


Explanation:

Query inside a query.

Can return scalar, list, or table.

Tricks:

Use IN for list subqueries.

Correlated subqueries reference outer query:

SELECT e1.name
FROM employees e1
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) 
                FROM employees e2
                WHERE e1.department = e2.department);

8. INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

Syntax:

-- Insert
INSERT INTO employees (name, salary)
VALUES ('John', 50000);

-- Update
UPDATE employees
SET salary = salary * 1.1
WHERE department = 'IT';

-- Delete
DELETE FROM employees
WHERE id = 10;


Tricks:

Always test WHERE conditions in SELECT before UPDATE/DELETE.

Use transactions (BEGIN/COMMIT) in practice.

9. Table Creation and Constraints

Syntax:

CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2),
    manager_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (manager_id) REFERENCES employees(id)
);


Explanation:

PRIMARY KEY → unique identifier

FOREIGN KEY → references another table

UNIQUE → prevents duplicates

Tricks:

Always define constraints for consistency.

For interview SQL 50: foreign keys → help in joins.

10. String and Date Functions

Examples:

-- String
SELECT CONCAT(first_name, ' ', last_name) AS full_name
FROM employees;

SELECT LENGTH(name) FROM employees;
SELECT UPPER(name), LOWER(name) FROM employees;

-- Date
SELECT CURRENT_DATE, NOW();
SELECT DATE_ADD(hire_date, INTERVAL 1 YEAR) FROM employees;
SELECT DATEDIFF(NOW(), hire_date) FROM employees;


Tricks:

String + date functions solve most SQL 50 “formatting” or “calculation” questions.

Pattern: find differences, calculate age, extract year/month/day, concatenate columns.

General Tricks for Solving SQL Problems

Read the question carefully: identify table and column requirements.

Start with SELECT *: first see what the raw data looks like.

Solve incrementally: filter → join → aggregate → order.

Use aliases for tables and columns for readability.

Think in terms of sets, not loops. SQL is set-based.

Draw a diagram if multiple joins are involved.

Test subqueries separately before combining.

Check NULLs — many errors come from unexpected NULLs.

💡 Pro Tips for SQL Interviews / SQL 50:

Start with SELECT * to understand data.

Solve incrementally: filter → join → aggregate → order.

Use table aliases (t1, t2) for multiple joins.

Test subqueries separately.

Watch out for NULLs in joins and aggregates.
