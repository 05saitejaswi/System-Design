✅ 1. SELECT Queries — Syntax
Basic SELECT
SELECT column1, column2
FROM table_name;

SELECT with WHERE
SELECT *
FROM table_name
WHERE condition;

Filtering
WHERE column = value
WHERE column != value
WHERE column > value
WHERE column LIKE '%text%'
WHERE column IS NULL
WHERE column IS NOT NULL

Sorting
ORDER BY column ASC;
ORDER BY column DESC;

✅ 2. JOINS — Syntax
INNER JOIN
SELECT a.col, b.col
FROM TableA a
JOIN TableB b
ON a.key = b.key;

LEFT JOIN
SELECT a.col, b.col
FROM TableA a
LEFT JOIN TableB b
ON a.key = b.key;

RIGHT JOIN
SELECT a.col, b.col
FROM TableA a
RIGHT JOIN TableB b
ON a.key = b.key;

FULL JOIN
SELECT a.col, b.col
FROM TableA a
FULL JOIN TableB b
ON a.key = b.key;

SELF JOIN
SELECT a.col, b.col
FROM Table a
JOIN Table b
ON a.key = b.key;

✅ 3. GROUP BY — Syntax
Group & aggregate
SELECT col, COUNT(*), SUM(col2), AVG(col3)
FROM table
GROUP BY col;

GROUP BY with HAVING
SELECT col, COUNT(*)
FROM table
GROUP BY col
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

✅ 4. Subqueries — Syntax
Subquery in WHERE
SELECT *
FROM table
WHERE column IN (
    SELECT column FROM table2 WHERE condition
);

Subquery in FROM
SELECT t.col, t.col2
FROM (
    SELECT * FROM table WHERE condition
) AS t;

✅ 5. Window Functions — Syntax
ROW_NUMBER
SELECT col,
       ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY group_col ORDER BY sort_col) AS rn
FROM table;

RANK / DENSE_RANK
RANK() OVER (ORDER BY col)
DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY col)

SUM / AVG over window
SUM(col) OVER (PARTITION BY group_col)

✅ 6. UNION / INTERSECT — Syntax
UNION
SELECT col FROM table1
UNION
SELECT col FROM table2;

UNION ALL
SELECT col FROM table1
UNION ALL
SELECT col FROM table2;

INTERSECT
SELECT col FROM table1
INTERSECT
SELECT col FROM table2;

✅ 7. JOIN + GROUP BY (very common in SQL50)
SELECT p.col, COUNT(*)
FROM TableA a
JOIN TableB b
ON a.id = b.id
GROUP BY p.col;

✅ 8. DELETE / UPDATE — Syntax
DELETE
DELETE FROM table
WHERE condition;

UPDATE
UPDATE table
SET column = value
WHERE condition;
